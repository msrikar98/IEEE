			    <p>Education is every child`s right. It equips them with knowledge and skills. They need to realize their potential to protect themselves from being sunk deeper in to quagmire. To promulgate them with better quality of life one should achieve success in life, it can be attained through better education. This sought of change translates in to huge benefits of society</p>

				<p>KLU IEEE Student Branch conducted its first STAR event on 24th January 2013. This is an awareness programme conducted by the WIE student members of K.L.University. The main objective of this programme is to provide consciousness to the school students regarding their safety and to show them various career opportunities awaiting them in the society. During the first session the Students were educated the inevitability of being physically and mentally fit and were asked to mentor their respective careers and they were also told regarding the necessity of the effective communication skills.</p>

				<p>WIE members empowered girls by addressing about adverse effects faced by girls in present society and elucidated them to work hard to gap those barriers. During the final session, pupils have personally interacted with our organizers regarding their career paths and questions were queried about the scope of engineering. In this session the students were facilitated with ideas of acquiring the best career, they were motivated and encouraged to develop their personality and knowledge.</p>

				<p>The enthusiasm shown by students accentuates their zeal to seek knowledge and experience from organizers is quiet creditable. We have even suggested to the management of the school to take cognizance on the personality development of students which are essential to cope up with the competitive world and also eventually help them reach apogee. Students thanked the captivate approach taken by WIE members to deal with aspects which are certainly important for them to hone their skills. Stressing against the crux of the issues like child marriages in this community, students have been suggested to be firm while convincing their parents and make them understand how important it is for a women to be educated.</p>

				<p>We are gratified by the advocacy of our WIE counselor to make this event successful and providing an immense opportunity to interact with students who are in dire need of awareness about their career<p>

			<h5>
			    
			<p>To bridge the gap between theoretical aspects what students learn in classrooms and practical approach done in industries IEEE KLU SB has organized an industrial visit to S.V.R. ELECTRICALS which enhances the pragmatic knowledge of students.</p>

			<p>S.V.R. ELECTRICALS is renowned for manufacturing transformer in coastal region of AP and also engaged in manufacturing Power, Distribution & Special application type of transformers. Students were explained about the different types of transformer available for various applications and utilities. Construction of winding, core and finally assembling them to form a transformer is authentically described. Trainer`s knowledge has helped us a lot in understanding possible methods of maintaining insulation between windings and other conducting material of the transformer lucidly. Purity of oil is an important factor to cool the transformer simultaneously; this crude oil is brought to the industry and refined to eliminate minute particles which may cause breakdown of transformer occasionally. Different temperature chambers at which oil is passed and improves its insulation capability was enunciated to the participants.</p>

			<p>We were glad to be shown about various testing procedures of transformer like open circuit test, short circuit test, high voltage test, insulation test, double frequency test, heat run test, resistance and breakdown voltage test. This exposure will make students to comprehend their peer knowledge on transformers. Students were cautioned about the high end results for improper manufacturing, which leads to short circuit to windings and loss of entire equipment. transformers are designed even to withstand fluctuation in voltage levels.</p>
  
			<p>These industrial visits will encompass the higher learning capability, effective interaction with industry & to know about updating technology in industry for student.</p>
			<h3>Students Opinion:</h3>
			<blockquote>
			<p>K.L.University has helped us to secure necessary training sessions and procure sufficient knowledge on transformer construction. They helped us have a practical exposure on the technical topics taught in our regular lecturers. The company trainers are successful enough to balance between technical excellence and industrial duty. It was great experience to know the industry internally.</p>
			<p>-K. Vamsi Krishna</P>
